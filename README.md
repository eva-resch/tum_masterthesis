# 📘 Master Thesis – Graphical Lyapunov Models on Intervention Data

Welcome to the repository for my Master's thesis: **Graphical Lyapunov Models on Intervention Data**, completed as part of the requirements for the MSc in Mathematics at Technical University of Munich (TUM).

This repository contains the Python code and Jupyter notebooks used to conduct the simulation studies for the thesis.

## 🧠 Thesis Overview

Brief summary of your thesis:

**Goal**: Describe the objective or research question.

**Methodology**: High-level overview of methods used (e.g., simulations, modeling, optimization, etc.).

**Outcome**: Key findings or insights from your work.

## 📂 Repository Structure

<pre>
  📁 Irrepresentability/     # Jupyter notebooks for simulations and analysis 
  📁 Lasso/                  # (Optional) Sample or synthetic data used in simulations 
  📁 Rank Condition/         # (Optional) Output figures, tables, or metrics 
  📄 README.md               # This file
